## Thesis Statement

**I DIDN'T HAVE A THESIS STATEMENT BEFORE**

##### BEFORE:

<del>Finding the word which has meaningful impact on me it’s really difficult. Maybe it is because of my nation. I mean that I born in country where people don’t speak English language. Also, somehow, I love English language but I don’t mean love language like knowing English grammar, but I love English in a way that I can use it in my life such as talking, chatting with people or translating my short films and music videos. Thanks to this I feel that I have more options in my life which is very good.</del> etc.

##### AFTER:

Why shouldn’t we use the word Awesome? Is it due to grammar, or is it considered incorrect? Or perhaps ther's another reason!? Those questions I asked myself a lot in the past. Let me share the story behind my relationship with that word.
